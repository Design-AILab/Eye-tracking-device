# Eye-tracking-device
## Eye-tracking WebApp
Integrate WebGazer.js into a Flask Framework.

### Currently Working on:
* Phase 1
* Set up two buttons: Start and End
* Start will start the webgazer and show prediction points 
* End will end the webgazer

## Goals
### Phase 1: Get webgaze.js working
* Integrate webgazer.js into the flask webapp (single page)
* start webgazer, which starts collecting points in which and transmitting the data to the backend
* upon ending (have a button that ends the process), stop the webgazer (webgazer.end();) and stop transmitting data
* save the coordinates to models py

### Phase 2: Upload functions
* allow users to upload a design
* when the design is shown, webgzer begins 
* after the process is ended (user ends the detection process), the detection is saved
* the positions are evaluated, outputting a heatmap of where the user looks at on the design (make sure that the gaze coordinates that were outside of the boundaries of the uploaded designs are filtered out)

### Phase 3: Completion
* add complementary features to make the process easier
* add calibration so that eyetracking could be better (webgazer does not require calibration but relies on user's interaction with the interface, the more the user interacts with the webpage, the more accurate webgazer is, therefore, having an initial interaction where we induce users to click on stuff could improve the accuracy of the webgazer when they user views the designs)
